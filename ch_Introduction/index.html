            These are the three major benefits of CSS:

    <div class="subHead-1">
        <h3>
            1) Solves a big problem.
        </h3>
    </div>

    <div class="para3">
        <p>
            Before CSS, tags like font, color, background style, element alignments,
            border and size had to be repeated on every webpage. This was a very long process.
            For example: If you are developing a large website where fonts and color information
            are added on every single page,
            it will be become a long and expensive process.
            CSS was created to solve this problem.
            It was a W3C recommendation.

    <div class="subHead-2">
        <h3>
            2) Saves a lot of time.
        </h3>
    </div>

    <div class="para3">
        <p>
            CSS style definitions are
            saved in external CSS files so it is possible to change the
            entire website by changing just
            one file.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="subHead-3">
        <h3>
            3) Provide more attributes.
        </h3>
    </div>

    <div class="para3">
        <p>
            CSS provides more detailed
            attributes than plain HTML to define the look
            and feel of the website.
